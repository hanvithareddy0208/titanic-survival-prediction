ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, sex, class, and more. This classic classification problem is based on the Kaggle Titanic dataset.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset is available on Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster. It includes the following features:
PassengerId
Pclass (Ticket class)
Name
Sex
Age
SibSp (# of siblings / spouses aboard)
Parch (# of parents / children aboard)
Ticket
Fare
Cabin
Embarked (Port of Embarkation)
The target variable is:
Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

TECHNOLOGIES USED :
pycharm 

Installed libraries:
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

ðŸ§  Model
The model is typically a classification algorithm such as:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost
Performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

âœ… Features Used
After preprocessing, the following features were used in the model:
Pclass
Sex
Age (imputed)
SibSp
Parch
Fare
Embarked

ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation
Sample model performance:
Accuracy: 0.80
Precision: 0.78
Recall: 0.75
F1 Score: 0.76
Note: Results may vary based on feature engineering and model used.
